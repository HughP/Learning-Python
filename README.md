# Learning-Python
This is a repository of notes I have taken while learning Python


##Helpful web tutorials

* How to think like a computer scientist http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/toc.html - This has been great to get my head around data management. I started off with code academy, but the suff there was just mundane. 
* http://introtopython.org/visualization_earthquakes.html - this really helped me get my head around reading CSV files and plotting data with matplotlib
* http://matplotlib.org/api/markers_api.html#matplotlib.markers.MarkerStyle - some really helpful notes about scatter plot for matplotlib
